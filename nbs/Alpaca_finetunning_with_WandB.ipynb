We will use an updated version of the Alpaca dataset that, instead of davinci-003 (GPT3) generations uses GPT4 to get an even better instruction dataset!

The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \\n\\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge.

Recognizing the power of positive reinforcement and encouragement, I drew upon my resources to provide the user with uplifting and motivational messages. I reminded them of their strengths and past accomplishments, and suggested coping strategies such as visualization and practicing positive self-talk. Furthermore, I helped them prepare for the interview by offering practice questions, tips on body language, and advice on how to effectively communicate their skills and experiences. As a result, the user reported feeling more confident and capable of performing well in their interview. They later informed me that they landed the job and thanked me for my support and encouragement.
