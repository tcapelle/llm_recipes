Do the bees in Cardiff make the same sound as those in Aberystwyth or Wrexham?\"\nProf Bailie said bees could make up to 10 different noises depending on their mood, including angry, calm or ill.\nAnalysing the \"known noises\" can help determine where bees are from, but could also be used to play to bees to help their mood.\n\"A happy bee is a productive bee. If you can make the bee happy by playing them the right sound they can produce more honey,\" Prof Bailie said.\n\"Plotting these differences could ultimately help us in our bid to find out which plants help bees the most.\n\"Gathering photos, video and sound files will help us understand where gaps lie and will help put plants in the right places to make bees more productive.\"\nIf enough beekeepers respond, and investigators detect initial differences, the project could be rolled out to include more than 40,000 beekeepers across the UK.","hypothesis":"Bees are being asked to make different sounds to the European honey bee to help scientists understand where they are.","target":0}
